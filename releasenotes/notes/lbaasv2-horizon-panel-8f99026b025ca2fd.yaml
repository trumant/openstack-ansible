    The new LBaaS v2 dashboard is available in Horizon. Deployers can enable
    the panel by setting the following Ansible variable:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        horizon_enable_neutron_lbaas: True

    The tasks in the os_horizon role will determine which LBaaS version is in
    use (via ``neutron_plugin_base``) and activate the correct panel for
    LBaaS v1 or v2.
