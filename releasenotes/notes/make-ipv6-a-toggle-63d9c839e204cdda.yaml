    Horizon's IPv6 support is now configurable with Ansible variables.
    Deployers can enable IPv6 support in Horizon by setting the following
    variable:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        horizon_enable_ipv6: True

    Please note: Horizon will still display IPv6 addresses in various panels
    with IPv6 support disabled. However, it will not allow any direct
    management of IPv6 configuration.
