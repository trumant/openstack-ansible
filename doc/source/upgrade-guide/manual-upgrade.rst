Manual Upgrade Steps
====================

The steps detailed here match those performed by the ``run-upgrade.sh``
script. Any of these steps can safely be run multiple times.

Check out the Mitaka release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure your OpenStack-Ansible code is on the latest Mitaka release tag (13.x.x).

.. code-block:: console

    # git checkout stable/mitaka
    # LATEST_TAG=$(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags)
    # git checkout ${LATEST_TAG}

Preparing the shell variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    This step is optional, since these environment variables are simply
    shortcuts. Files can be referenced directly.

From the ``openstack-ansible`` root directory, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    # export MAIN_PATH="$(pwd)"
    # export SCRIPTS_PATH="${MAIN_PATH}/scripts"
    # export UPGRADE_PLAYBOOKS="${SCRIPTS_PATH}/upgrade-utilities/playbooks"

These variables reduce typing when running the remaining upgrade
tasks.

Re-bootstrap Ansible for Mitaka
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bootstrapping Ansible again ensures that all OpenStack-Ansible role
dependencies are in place before running playbooks from the Mitaka
release.

.. code-block:: console

    # ${SCRIPTS_PATH}/bootstrap-ansible.sh

Change to playbooks directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Change to the playbooks directory so that the OpenStack-Ansible dynamic
inventory is found automatically.

.. code-block:: console

    # cd playbooks

Update configuration and environment files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user configuration files in ``/etc/openstack_deploy/`` and the environment
layout in ``/etc/openstack_deploy/env.d`` have new name
values added in Mitaka.

See :ref:`config-change-playbook` for more details.

.. code-block:: console

    # openstack-ansible "${UPGRADE_PLAYBOOKS}/deploy-config-changes.yml"

Update user secrets file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mitaka introduces new user secrets to the stack. These are populated
automatically with the following playbook.

See :ref:`user-secrets-playbook` for more details.

.. code-block:: console

    # openstack-ansible "${UPGRADE_PLAYBOOKS}/user-secrets-adjustment.yml"

Upgrade hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before installing the infrastructure and OpenStack, update the host machines.

.. code-block:: console

    # openstack-ansible setup-hosts.yml --limit '!galera_all[0]'

This command is the same as doing host setups on a new install. The first
member of the ``galera_all`` host group is excluded to prevent simultaneous
restarts of all Galera containers.

Update Galera LXC container configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update the first Galera container's configuration independently.

.. code-block:: console

    # openstack-ansible lxc-containers-create.yml --limit galera_all[0]

This command is a subset of the host setup playbook, limited to the first
member of the ``galera_all`` host group so that its container is restarted only
after other Galera containers have been restarted in the previous step.

Cleanup ``pip.conf`` file in the ``repo_servers``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a ``pip.conf`` file exists within the repository server
infrastructure, it can cause build failures when upgrading
to Mitaka. This play removes the ``pip.conf`` file from the repository
servers.

See :ref:`repo-server-pip-conf-removal` for more details.

.. code-block:: console

    # openstack-ansible "${UPGRADE_PLAYBOOKS}/repo-server-pip-conf-removal.yml"

Ensure hostname aliases are created for non-RFC1034/35 hostnames
----------------------------------------------------------------

Ensure an alias is created for non-RFC1034/35 hostnames.

See :ref:`old-hostname-compatibility` for details.

.. code-block:: console

    # openstack-ansible "${UPGRADE_PLAYBOOKS}/old-hostname-compatibility.yml"

Upgrade infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running the standard OpenStack-Ansible infrastructure playbook applies the
relevant Mitaka settings and packages. This upgrade is required for the Mitaka
release of OpenStack-Ansible.

For certain versions of Liberty, you must upgrade the RabbitMQ service.

See :ref:`setup-infra-playbook` for details.

.. code-block:: console

    # openstack-ansible setup-infrastructure.yml -e 'galera_upgrade=true' \
    -e 'rabbitmq_upgrade=true'

Upgrade OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upgrade the OpenStack components with the same installation playbook,
without any additional options.

.. code-block:: console

    # openstack-ansible setup-openstack.yml
