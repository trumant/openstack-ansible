Scripts
=======

This section describes scripts that are used in the upgrade process in detail.

Within the main :file:`scripts` directory there is a :file:`upgrade-utilities`
directory, which contains additional scripts that facilitate the initial
upgrade process.

``run-upgrade.sh``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This script controls the overall upgrade process for deployers choosing not to
do so manually.

It provides the following environment variables:

    * ``SCRIPTS_PATH`` - path to the top level scripts directory
    * ``MAIN_PATH`` - openstack_ansible root directory.
    * ``UPGRADE_PLAYBOOKS`` - path to the playbooks used in upgrading

The upgrade script also bootstraps OpenStack-Ansible (using
``bootstrap-ansible.sh``) in order to provide the new role dependencies
introduced in the Liberty series.

.. _migrate-os-vars:

``migrate_openstack_vars.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upstream decisions influenced the change of some variable names in Liberty.
This script replaces any instances of these strings in the
variable override files matching the pattern
``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_*.yml``.
Variable names within comments are updated.

This script creates files of the form
``/etc/openstack_deploy.MITAKA/VARS_MIGRATED_file``. For example, once the script has
processed the file ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_variables.yml``, it creates
``/etc/openstack_deploy.MITAKA/VARS_MIGRATED_user_variables``. This indicates to
OpenStack-Ansible to skip this step on successive runs. The script itself does
not check for this file.

The variable changes are shown in the following table.

.. This table was made with the output of
   ``scripts/upgrade-utilities/scripts/make_rst_table.py``. Insertion needs to be
   done manually since the OpenStack publish jobs do not use `make` and there
   is not yet a Sphinx extension that runs an abitrary script on build.
