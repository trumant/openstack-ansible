`Home <index.html>`_ OpenStack-Ansible Installation Guide

Initial environment configuration
=================================

OpenStack-Ansible depends on various files that are used to build an inventory
for Ansible. Start by getting those files into the correct places:

#. Copy the contents of the
   ``/opt/openstack-ansible/etc/openstack_deploy`` directory to the
   ``/etc/openstack_deploy`` directory.

#. Change to the ``/etc/openstack_deploy`` directory.

#. Copy the ``openstack_user_config.yml.example`` file to
   ``/etc/openstack_deploy/openstack_user_config.yml``.

You can review the ``openstack_user_config.yml`` file and make changes
to the deployment of your OpenStack environment.

.. note::

   The file is heavily commented with details about the various options.

There are various types of physical hardware that are able to use containers
deployed by OpenStack-Ansible. For example, hosts listed in the
`shared-infra_hosts` run containers for many of the shared services that
your OpenStack environments requires. Some of these services include databases,
memcached, and RabbitMQ. There are several other host types that contain
other types of containers and all of these are listed in
``openstack_user_config.yml``.

For details about how the inventory is generated from the environment
configuration, see :ref:`developer-inventory`.

Affinity
~~~~~~~~

OpenStack-Ansible's dynamic inventory generation has a concept called
`affinity`. This determines how many containers of a similar type are deployed
onto a single physical host.

Using `shared-infra_hosts` as an example, consider this ``openstack_user_config.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    shared-infra_hosts:
      infra1:
        ip: 172.29.236.101
      infra2:
        ip: 172.29.236.102
      infra3:
        ip: 172.29.236.103

Three hosts are assigned to the `shared-infra_hosts` group,
OpenStack-Ansible ensures that each host runs a single database container,
a single memcached container, and a single RabbitMQ container. Each host has
an affinity of 1 by default, and that means each host will run one of each
container type.

You can skip the deployment of RabbitMQ altogether. This is
helpful when deploying a standalone swift environment. If you need
this configuration, your ``openstack_user_config.yml`` would look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    shared-infra_hosts:
      infra1:
        affinity:
          rabbit_mq_container: 0
        ip: 172.29.236.101
      infra2:
        affinity:
          rabbit_mq_container: 0
        ip: 172.29.236.102
      infra3:
        affinity:
          rabbit_mq_container: 0
        ip: 172.29.236.103

The configuration above deploys a memcached container and a database
container on each host, without the RabbitMQ containers.


.. _security_hardening:

Security hardening
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deployers have the option to automatically apply security hardening to an
OpenStack Ansible deployment using the `openstack-ansible-security`_ role. The
role uses a version of the `Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG)`_
that has been adapted for Ubuntu 14.04 and OpenStack.

The role is applicable to physical hosts within an OpenStack-Ansible deployment
that are operating as any type of node, infrastructure or compute. By
default, the role is enabled. You can enable it by changing a variable
within ``user_variables.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    apply_security_hardening: true

When the variable is set, the role will be applied by the ``setup-hosts.yml``
playbook automatically during deployments.

You can apply security configurations to an existing environment or audit
an environment using a playbook supplied with OpenStack-Ansible:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Perform a quick audit using Ansible's check mode
    openstack-ansible --check security-hardening.yml

    # Apply security hardening configurations
    openstack-ansible security-hardening.yml

For more details on the security configurations that will be applied, refer to
the `openstack-ansible-security`_ documentation. Review the `Configuration`_
section of the openstack-ansible-security documentation to find out how to
fine-tune certain security configurations.
