Security
========

The OpenStack-Ansible project provides several security features for
OpenStack deployments. This section of documentation covers those
features and how they can benefit deployers of various sizes.

Security requirements always differ between deployers. If you require
additional security measures, refer to the official
`OpenStack Security Guide`_ for additional resources.

AppArmor
~~~~~~~~

The Linux kernel offers multiple `security modules`_ (LSMs) that that set
`mandatory access controls`_ (MAC) on Linux systems.  The OpenStack-Ansible
project configures `AppArmor`_. AppArmor is a Linux security module that
provides additional security on LXC container hosts. AppArmor allows
administrators to set specific limits and policies around what resources a
particular application can access. Any activity outside the allowed policies
is denied at the kernel level.

AppArmor profiles that are applied in OpenStack-Ansible limit the actions
that each LXC container may take on a system. This is done within the
`lxc_hosts role`_.

Encrypted communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While in transit, data is encrypted between some OpenStack services in
OpenStack-Ansible deployments. Not all communication between all services is
encrypted. For more details on what traffic is encrypted, and how
to configure SSL certificates, refer to the documentation section titled
`Securing services with SSL certificates`_.

.. _Securing services with SSL certificates: configure-sslcertificates.html

Host security hardening
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deployers can apply security hardening to OpenStack infrastructure and compute
hosts using the ``openstack-ansible-security`` role. The purpose of the role is to
apply as many security configurations as possible without disrupting the
operation of an OpenStack deployment.

Refer to the documentation on :ref:`security_hardening` for more information
on the role and how to enable it in OpenStack-Ansible.

Least privilege
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `principle of least privilege`_ is used throughout OpenStack-Ansible to
limit the damage that could be caused if an attacker gained access to a set of
credentials.

OpenStack-Ansible configures unique username and password combinations for
each service that talks to RabbitMQ and Galera/MariaDB. Each service that
connects to RabbitMQ uses a separate virtual host for publishing and consuming
messages. The MariaDB users for each service are only granted access to the
database(s) that they need to query.

Securing network access to OpenStack services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenStack environments expose many service ports and API endpoints to the
network. 

.. note::
   
   Deployers must limit access to these resources and expose them only
   to trusted users and networks.

The resources within an OpenStack environment can be divided into two groups:

1. Services that users must access directly to consume the OpenStack cloud.

   * Aodh
   * Cinder
   * Ceilometer
   * Glance
   * Heat
   * Horizon
   * Keystone *(excluding the admin API endpoint)*
   * Neutron
   * Nova
   * Swift

2. Services that are only utilized internally by the OpenStack cloud.

   * Keystone (admin API endpoint)
   * MariaDB
   * RabbitMQ

To manage instances, you are able to access certain public API endpoints, such as
the Nova or Neutron API. Configure firewalls to limit network access to
these services.

Other services, such as MariaDB and RabbitMQ, must be segmented away from
direct user access. You must configure a firewall to only allow
connectivity to these services within the OpenStack environment itself. This
reduces an attacker's ability to query or manipulate data in OpenStack's
critical database and queuing services, especially if one of these services has
a known vulnerability.

For more details on recommended network policies for OpenStack clouds, refer to
the `API endpoint process isolation and policy`_ section from the `OpenStack
Security Guide`_
