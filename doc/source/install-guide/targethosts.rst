We recommend at least five target hosts to contain the
OpenStack environment and supporting infrastructure for the OSA
installation process. On each target host, perform the following tasks:

-  Naming target hosts

-  Install the operating system

-  Generate and set up security measures

-  Update the operating system and install additional software packages

-  Create LVM volume groups

-  Configure networking devices
